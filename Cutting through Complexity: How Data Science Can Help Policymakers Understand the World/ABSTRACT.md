Economies are fundamentally complex and becoming more so, but the new discipline of data

science—which combines programming, statistics, and domain knowledge—can help cut through

that complexity, potentially with productivity benefits to boot. This chapter looks at examples of

where innovations from data science are cutting through the complexities faced by policymakers

in measurement, allocating resources, monitoring the natural world, making predictions, and more.

These examples show the promise and potential of data science to aid policymakers, and point to

where actions may be taken that would support further progress in this space.
