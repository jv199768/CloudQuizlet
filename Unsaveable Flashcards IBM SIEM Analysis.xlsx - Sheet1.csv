It is used to identify unlinked URLs or IPs from a website to gain access to unprotected resources. In this scenario, forced browsing, and not website enumeration, is used to identify unlinked URLs or IPs from a website to gain access to unprotected resources. Forced browsing is an attack technique where an attacker manually iterates through possible URLs to find unprotected content. Website enumeration is done during the footprinting and reconaissance stage. The team will need to determine how the target hosts the site, which can either be self-hosted or cloud-based. Website enumeration involves discovering resources that are in use as well as the underlying technology used to host the server. According to OWASP, enumeration is also referred to as Predictable Resource Location, File Enumeration or Directory Enumeration."

Users often adopt poor credential management habits, such as choosing bad passwords, writing down passwords, and reusing passwords on third-party sites.
Administrators are often granted too many privileges or abuse accounts with ""super"" privileges for routine log-ons. A shared account is when the password (or other authentication credential) is shared with more than one person and a single ""Admin"" account is used to manage a device. A shared account should be avoided, as it breaks the principal of nonrepudiation and makes an accurate audit trail difficult to establish. "

Robert is leading a PenTesting team. He wants to download and run a script. He has asked your advice on using a simple one-line of code from PowerShell that can easily do this. What would you recommend?,
Robert has asked you to suggest a tool to use so that he can enumerate users and assets with a view to attacking the usernames. What would you recommend?,Meterpreter. It is very common and is part of the Metasploit framework. 
Robert has asked you about reverse engineering. He knows that there are three primary methods of doing this but he cannot remember what they are. Can you help him?,"Decompliation, disassembly, debugging"
"Your team has a problem. They want to write a script but don’t know how to make things execute in the order they want, or to change the order when circumstances change. What is the concept associated with making a program execute its commands in a prescribed order?",
"Your colleagues come to you with a question. They want to develop a script to show basic flow and functionality, but they haven’t yet decided which language to write the script in. Can you help?","They should write the script using Pseudocode. Pseudocode is a made-up language used to show flow and logic, but is not based on any programming or scripting language. Once the script is written in Pseudocode, it can easily be adapted to the actual language that will be used."
Your colleagues want to use a data construct to exfiltrate data from multiple programs in plaintext. They want to be able to make the export portable between applications. What could they use?,"A CSV file and format should be used. A comma-separated value (CSV) file is exactly as its name suggests: a file where entries are separated by commas. Originally used as an export from spreadsheets, CSV files have become a very popular way to import and export data. Complex data files can be transported as a CSV file in plain text. Each entry in the CSV file is a field, and the fields are separated by commas. Typically, each line is an individual record. Considering a CSV as a spreadsheet, each field would be an entry in a column, and each line would be a row. Typically, the first line of a CSV file, defines the field or column headers."
Your newest team member has been asked to use Python scripting for a PenTest project. They are concerned about writing the script from scratch and think there is a lot of work involved. Do you have any suggestions for them?,Consider using libraries of pre-existing code that can be leveraged to help build the script
Where would your newest team member get these modules from?,"Inbuilt in Python, Github, or other available library."
Your newest team member has been asked to use Python scripting for a PenTest project. They need to write a script but do not know how to make the program access the desired libraries that they have downloaded. What command do you recommend that they use?,import
Which AQL function would you use to extract specific fields from event data in QRadar?,SELECT
What is the difference between a fully matched rule and a partially matched rule in QRadar?,
What is a common challenge when triaging offenses with low credibility and low relevance scores?,They are usually false positives
When should an analyst use an Ariel offense instead of an events or flows search?,"To review triggered correlation rules - Offenses searches in Ariel are tailored to identify triggered correlation rules and offenses in QRadar. Packet-level analysis is performed using flows searches, raw log reviews are done with logs searches, and traffic volume statistics are handled through flows searches."
What is a key benefit of using drill-down capabilities in QRadar Pulse Dashboards?,Rapidly access detailed event data from a widget
Malicious IP Investigation,Identifying assets affected by a harmful IP. 
View Destination Summary,Lists assets communicating with a specific IP
Your team has been engaged to test a client’s defenses. The team has decided that a password cracking attack would be a good place to start. What are the main attack options they could use?,"They could conduct their assaults online or offline. There are a variety of attacks they could utilize, including:

Offline cracking
Dictionary attack
Brute force attack
Rule attack
Mask attack
Spraying
Phishing
Malware
Social engineering
Shoulder surfing
Keylogger"
"Your team has asked advice on some passwords they have found traces of, on Windows devices that are stored in the Security Account Manager (SAM). You inform the team that passwords are usually stored as one of two types of hashes. What are those two types?","LanMan (LM) hash: Before hashing, passwords are converted to uppercase and then either truncated or padded to become 14 characters long. The actual value that is stored is not the password hash itself. Instead, the hash is divided into two 7-byte parts, each of which is used as a 56-bit DES key to encrypt the fixed string ""KGS!@#$%"". Because the hash is unsalted, it is susceptible to dictionary and rainbow table attacks.
NT hash: This is a simple MD4 hash of the password (encoded as UTF-16 little endian). It is unsalted but allows passwords up to 128 characters long."
"There are many password-cracking tools available, with many being multi-featured. Your team wants a recommendation for a password-cracking tool that has the ability to use multiple CPUs, enable portability, and can pause the cracking on one device while resuming it on a different one. Which tool would you recommend that can do this?",John the Ripper has the ability to use multiple CPUs and enables portability because it can pause the cracking in one device to resume on a different one. 
Your team wants to ensure that their test encompasses more than just a narrow selection of resources. They would like to try to gain access to the initial part of the environment and then spread out their attack to compromise additional resources. What is this process called?,Lateral movement
"The team has heard about a ""pass the hash"" attack but is not sure what it entails. Could you briefly explain it to them?","A pass the hash attack is when you log on to the target operating system or application providing the username and the hash of the password, rather than the password itself. You obtain the hash by inducing the operating system or application to dump them from RAM, the Windows Registry, or a credentials file. "
"As part of the process of moving through the system, the PenTest team encounters a major challenge: they do not have access to the resources they need. What options should their manager recommend that they try?","Privilege escalation. There are two important ways in which this is performed that need to be taken into consideration.

Vertical Privilege Escalation is to obtain access to an account of higher privilege than the one you currently have, in order to enable administrative resources that the regular user does not have permission for.
Horizontal Privilege Escalation is obtaining access to a regular user account of different privilege than the one currently in use, to enable private resources you otherwise do not have permission for."
"What is a major necessity, in regard to your client or employer, during the process of a PenTesting project?",Open lines of communication with the client or employer's IT security team.
You have been assigned to lead a PenTesting team on a client project. Your first choice is to commence a social engineering attack. What is a major consideration that you should discuss with your client?,"Do they want to keep it secret or will they be telling their employees to expect it? If they tell their employees, the test may fail. "
You have been assigned to lead a PenTesting team. You need to set up lines of communication. What are some of the categories of contacts you should establish?,Primary contact. Technical contact. Emergency contact. 
,"Some reasons to initiate client communication (the correct answer is any, or all, of the following):

Status reports
Critical findings
Indicators of prior compromise
Goal reprioritization"
What is one way the situation could be addressed if your team's PenTest attempt is discovered?,"One option is to de-escalate the test—to scale it back, until the defense has been halted. From the client side, the team that is aware of the PenTest could de-conflict the breach, enabling it to continue."
Automated scans have the potential to produce a large number of false positives. There are several tactics you can employ to identify false positives. What is one of the most effective?,"Results validation. Through a validation process, you compare what you've learned about the target environment to individual scan results and identify whether or not the results are truly applicable and accurate."
"When your team begins creating their final PenTest report, what are some of the general considerations about the target audience that they must think about before they start writing?","The systems that were tested, the stakeholders, and whether your team is an external or internal entity. "
"When the final target of your team's final PenTest report is C-Suite executives, what is an important consideration?",To ensure that they understand impact of the findings. (They make their decisions based on results and recommendations).
"In cases where the PenTest target was a project for which developers are particularly responsible, they will also be directly involved in implementing the resolution and mitigation techniques that need to be addressed. What type of practices would your team recommend that they adopt?","Often, these can be addressed through the adoption of Secure Development Software Practices."
"The written report is likely to be read by a variety of audiences. This might include board members, end users, and technical administrators. They all need to be able to read and understand the information you provide. So you need to target your report to account for these differences. What is a common way of achieving this?",
"Your team’s PenTest report should account for your client’s risk appetite. At the beginning of the PenTest process, what kinds of questions could you ask them to assess the amount of risk they would be willing to accept?","The client's key stakeholders need to determine their risk appetite by answering questions such as:

What losses would be catastrophic to the organization?
What processes, technology, or other assets can be unavailable and still enable the organization to function, and for how long?
What assets, processes, information, or technology must be available at all times and cannot be made public or be accessed by unapproved persons?
Are there any circumstances that could result in personal harm to anyone dealing with the organization, be it employees, customers, business partners, or visitors?"
"As a result of your team's report, your client has asked for some suggestions for physical instrusion recommendations. What would you suggest?","Security cameras, security guards, motion detectors, fencing and gates, RFID systems that use encryption. "
What is a good standard to use when presenting your team's penetration test findings?,Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES). 
How should you present your team's findings/results?,In a way that is easily readable and meaningful
"When using the PTES standard, what classifications of vulnerabilities might your team address?",Technical and Logical
"Your colleague, who has just overseen and concluded a PenTest project, is requesting some advice on the best practices for the secure handling of their PenTest reports. What would you suggest?","The following are some best practices for the secure handling of reports:

Maintain the confidentiality of reports and their contents.
Maintain the integrity of reports and their contents.
Ensure reports are always available to the relevant audience.
Ensure reports are secure in transit (including across a network).
Minimize the transmission of reports across a public network like the internet.
Ensure reports are secure in storage.
Protect reports and their contents from accidental disclosure.
Maintain audit logs for users accessing reports.
Maintain a chain of custody when transferring ownership of reports.
Maintain version control for changes to reports."
Your client has asked about the common root causes of vulnerabilities. What are some recurring conditions or common themes that can cause vulnerabilities to emerge?,"Some recurring conditions and/or common themes that can be the root cause of vulnerabilities are:

Lax physical security
Employees not following corporate policy or best practices
Lack of adequate cybersecurity training
Lack of software patching and updating
Lack of operating system hardening
Poor software development practices
Use of outdated networking protocols
Use of obsolete cryptographic protocols"
Your colleague is writing their first PenTest report and has asked you for advice. What are some of the sections you would suggest that they consider including in their report?,"They should consider including the following sections in their report:

Executive summary
Scope details
Methodology
Attack narrative
Findings
Risk rating
Risk prioritization
Metrics and measures
Remediation
Conclusion
Appendix or supporting evidence"
Your client wants to harden their system. They have asked you for advice. What are some of the techniques available to achieve this?,
Your company has become very security-aware and wants to protect themselves from malicious actors. They have heard about multi-factor authentication. They have asked you to explain it to them so that they understand what it is. What would you say?,"Generally, authentication is classified as one of three types: something you know, something you are, something you have. Multi-factor authentication is simply a combination of two, or more, of these types. "
You have been asked to segment your client’s network to strengthen their security posture. What is a basic or common method of doing this?,"You would determine which services need to be internet-facing, which ones need to be both internet-facing and internally accessible, and which should be kept internal only. Network segmentation would separate these into different locations and only certain users and services would be allowed to communicate between the different segments."
"Your company started small but is growing. They used to allow everyone access to all areas of the business. Now that the company has become significantly larger, they have asked you to recommend a solution for the problem of segmentation for security purposes. What would you suggest?","Your company started small but is growing. They used to allow everyone access to all areas of the business. Now that the company has become significantly larger, they have asked you to recommend a solution for the problem of segmentation for security purposes. What would you suggest?"
You have been asked to train your client’s IT team with a view to improving the standard of password storage and transmission within the company. What initial advice will you provide?,"Answer can be any/all of the following:

Don't allow developers to hard-code credentials in apps.
Hash stored passwords rather than storing them in plaintext.
Use cryptographically strong hash functions, like SHA-256 and bcrypt.
Avoid cryptographically weak hash functions, like MD5 and SHA-1.
Use network access protocols that encrypt passwords in transit.
For example, use SSH instead of Telnet, HTTPS instead of HTTP, FTPS instead of FTP, etc.
Ensure network access protocols are using strong ciphers, like AES-256 and RC6.
Avoid using network access protocols that incorporate weak cryptographic ciphers, like DES and 3DES.
Disallow or reconfigure services that allow themselves to be negotiated down to a weaker cryptographic or protocol version.
Ensure security solutions like IDS and data loss prevention (DLP) can monitor and manage unencrypted traffic in the network."
You have been asked for advice by your client. They need to know what very basic training they should give to their general employees about cybersecurity awareness. What would you say?,"Employees/users should be able to identify why it is important that everyone does their part in keeping the organization and its assets secure. Their training should include:

How to spot threats they might encounter on the job
The consequences of succumbing to threats
If users find a suspicious device, they should be aware that they need to let the IT department know about the device"
"The company wishes to harden their physical access. They have asked you to suggest methods of securing physical access into the building. Apart from the RFID card in the elevator, what other suggestions could you make for locations at which physical access control can be implemented?","The entry door to the building can be hardened with a keypad/passcode. Biometric controls, i.e., fingerprint scanners, could also be added. Alternately, multi-factor authentication—a combination of access controls – could be implemented (passcode + RFID pass, etc.)."
The company has decided to implement biometric controls. They would like two options to consider. You have been asked to recommend these. What could they be?,The company could implement fingerprint or iris scanners. It has been proven that these are unique to the individual and can be controlled by security to prevent an individual's access to the building in the event of a dismissal (face id is also becoming popular)
The company has asked you to provide a report on video surveillance. What are two main security vulnerabilities in using video surveillance?,"The system can be turned off (or wires cut or wires jammed), thus leaving the company without optical security. Alternatively, the system can be infiltrated and used against you. "
You are advising the PenTesting team on post-PenTest engagement cleanup. What are some of the common cleanup tasks that they should perform?,"Some common cleanup tasks can include, but are not limited to:

Delete any new files you created from the affected systems.
Remove any credentials or accounts you created from the affected systems.
Restore any original configurations you modified.
Restore any original files that you modified or otherwise compromised.
Restore any log files you deleted.
Restore any original log files you modified or otherwise compromised.
Remove any shells, RATs, or other backdoors from the affected systems.
Remove any additional tools you may have left on the affected systems.
Purge any sensitive data exposed in plaintext.
Restore a clean backup copy of any apps that you compromised."
"While you are advising the PenTesting team on cleanup, you should remind them about a possible tricky situation when removing their active directory (AD) account from a workstation. What is the thing that they need to watch out for?","If they created an AD account from a domain controller (DC) and then used that account to sign into a workstation, simply removing the account from the workstation will not remove it from the domain. They will need access to the DC to delete the AD account, otherwise a real attacker might be able to leverage this account by using it to sign into a DC."
"Your team is asking whether the deletion tool is good enough to get rid of their artifacts, tools, etc. What should you tell them?","Some of their tools are loaded into memory and are therefore automatically removed on system reboot (certain Metasploit payloads), whereas others linger on the target system until manually uninstalled. For the latter, a superficial deletion of the tool is not necessarily enough - they may need to, when possible, securely destroy (also referred to as shredding or purging) the tool's data and any associated files so that they cannot be recovered by an attacker or curious user. "
"As PenTest team lead, and in order to gain client acceptance of your final report, you need to provide something to the client to give them confidence in you. What is it?","Attestation. (Providing evidence to the client that the findings detailed in the PenTest report are true. In other words, by signing off on the report given to the client, you are attesting that you believe the information and conclusions in the report are authentic."
What should your team recommend to the client to help analyze the progress made in applying the mitigations to the attack vectors that were found during the penetration test.,A retest.
Your team has asked for help in drafting a Lessons Learned Report (LLR). What fundamental questions should you ask and answer about the PenTest in the report?,"Those questions can include:

What about the test went well?
What about the test didn't go well or didn't go as well as planned?
What can the team do to improve its people skills, processes, and technology for future client engagements?
What new vulnerabilities, exploits, etc., did the team learn about?
Do the answers to these questions necessitate a change in approach or testing methodology?
How will you remediate any issues that you identified?"
